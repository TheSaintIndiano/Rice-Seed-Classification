# Specific Objectives
Objectives of `Plant Disease Detection & Classification` is to build classifiers in different ways. One can see how CNN will extract features themself rather manually in other classifiers in the notebook. The following methods/classifiers are used.

1. Manual Classsification by thresholding
2. Support Vector Machine based Classification
3. Convolutional Neural Network based Classification
